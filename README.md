# My Temperature Package

Welcome to My Temperature Package! This package provides useful tools for data analysis, temperature calibration, and simulation. It includes the following classes:

- `ExploratoryDataAnalysis`: A class for performing exploratory data analysis on temperature data.
- `TemperatureCalibration`: A class for calibrating temperature sensors using reference data.
- `TemperatureSimulation`: A class for simulating temperature measurements based on a given model.

An exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the main characteristics of temperature data and identify appropriate statistical models for temperature simulation. Historical risk management methods, parametric methods, and scenario-based methods were also used to quantify temperature-related risks. Finally, temperature simulators were developed based on statistical models calibrated with historical data to generate future temperature scenarios.
